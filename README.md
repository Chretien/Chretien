- 👋 Hi, I’m @Chretien, and programming has always been an ambition of mine!
- I am currently learning how to leverage Python 🐍 in data analysis.
- In my previous career, I used Google Sheets on a daily basis to pull insights from data. Python is showing me how much more efficient I could have been.
- pandas is so much fun to learn and experiment with!
- Currently enrolled in Dataquest.io's Data Analyst with Python course, and loving every success and failure.
- When I'm not studying up on my Python, you can find me boxing, swinging my kettlebell, or playing League of Legends.
- I am a proud husband and father!
